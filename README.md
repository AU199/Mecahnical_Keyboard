# Mecahnical Keyboard
I made this projects because I wanted to learn how software and hardware come together inside something as simple keyboard (Which I found wasn't simple at all). I wanted to also learn how to make a PCB and how to CAD with better practices. This is a Mechanical keyboard that utilizes both a main chip and a "slave" chip (a chip made to work as if it were just an i/o extender). This uses a diode-matrix for the sensing and uses the SDA and SCL channels on the "slave" chip to read and understand.
