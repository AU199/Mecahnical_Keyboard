## 12/15/2025 - Learned the Ideas, and imported libraries  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I downloaded KiCad, and read the starting hackclub documentation on building a small keyboard. I had to work to download the libraries and had to research on how to do that. I started the schematics for the left part of the keyboard.

## 12/16/2025 2 PM - Started routing the PCB  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I started routing the PCB, but I faced a lot of issues with errors popping. I also found out about how netting actually works and what is it's uses in routing. I also found that the I was conflicted between the split design and making one whole keyboard. I ended up choosing the split design. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjUzNDMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c1b305e66d59631574a41ebc7bd941a7ca9066f0/image.png)
  

## 12/16/2025 5 PM - Changed the design  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I felt that it would be better if this was a single mechanical keyboard insted of two. As such I am going to be building a keyboard with two board, one main and the other acting as a slave-board. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjUzOTgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7412d73c321e5d56aba429b2203cb1f62c864aaf/image.png)![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjUzOTksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--fadfb44bcccc825b3fa7adf2cc486cd750458eed/image.png)

   

## 12/17/2025 - Started PCB, found flaw  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I started making the PCB and had finished routing when I realized that in my footprints I hadn't accounted for the fact that keys takes up space. this means that I have to change my keycaps to different type. 	![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjU5MzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--280498a1143c12e737dfcdada1720ae0f2b4ff0a/image.png)
  

## 12/21/2025 - Finished making the general pcb, started putting the diodes  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I understood what went wrong, as such using cherry switches I make sure that the footprints were actual to the real world. Now I have started the process of setting up the diodes for each switch. I have also started researching the places from which I can buy my switches and other items.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjc0NzksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--358c166d902c16c2ea04040031295236906c50c5/image.png)
  

## 12/23/2025 - Finished routing the PCB, looking for parts  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

Today I finally finished my pcb routing, and created a better border in order to reduce the size of the pcb. I also started researching PCBA services since I don't want to solder such small parts to my pcb. I have looked at JLCPCB, and found that they are the cheapest option. I am slowey coming to the end of the computer based design process.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjg1NDMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f33e2b61ea354510cfdcf1fe52fcc352e0677407/image.png)
  

## 12/26/2025 - Started CADing the case   

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

Using onshape, I have started CADing the base of the keyboard. I also started trying to price optimize with my product selection. I have tried finding everything in amazon just so that I try and reduce costs for delivery fee. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAyNTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--50d2351e5e366cbadebd6f016ecdc1ac0fb69e67/image.png)

  

## 12/27/2025 - Changed the CAD, and at the end of computer stuff  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

I have finished my cad along with switches and other items, I tweaked my design a little. I have finished my BOM, and now I am onto finishing my code for my keyboard. I am very close to finishing my project. I will add one of the 3D renders that I made using some random website :/.

## 12/28/2025 - Done with computer based items  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

I have Finished writing and making my Github. I am now going to be submitting. Now the wait will begin. I have learned a lot from this. I have only made basic PCBs before this and never actually manufactured it. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE1MDYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--41e14c8ae9d4dea06cecf0b219c90973070a8571/image.png)
  

## 1/1/2026 - Shipping information  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

As per the instructions of the person who reviewed this project, they told me to provide proof that the shipping option I had selected was the cheapest one. though the price of this one is a little lower (since for some reason JLC didn't allow me to go back and look at my order and take a screenshot of that) the idea and the problem is the same. Since my project weight is above the GSDL limit, I am using the next cheapest option FEDEX Express DDP, since that is the only option available that is cheap

These are the following prices and my project weight. I have the options selected as 5 PCBs and 2 PCBAs, the PCBAs are required as the things on there are SMDs resistors and diodes that would be really tedious to route again as well as resulting in a bigger overall pcb, which would bring up the same problem of dimensions.
(Don't worry about the hours, I had to add it because 0 hours wasn't allowed) (I love writing scholarship essays =) )
